# Functional Programming

PHP is not traditionally known for functional programming, but you can still write functional-style code in PHP. Below is a high-level example that demonstrates some functional programming concepts such as higher-order functions, closures, and immutability in PHP.
This repo has 5 small codes to give examples how to use in PHP

# 1. Partial Application
Partial application refers to the process of fixing a few arguments of a function and generating a new function. Here's a basic example using the bind function to partially apply arguments

# 2. Currying
Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.

# 3. Function Composition
Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

# 4. Memoization
Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

These are just some examples showcasing functional programming features in PHP. You can use these techniques to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
